Ans.1) This code i created is about finding a particular student's name and its placement in the list. The function finds the lenghth of the list and matches the input of the user with the names in the list.
Ands.2) This program can be used in Ofiices, Sports events and even in universities admissions. People and heads can use it for their conveninence and save time
Ans.3) It can benefit induvidiuals by saving their precious and vauable time. People can find the names of students from a long list with just one click
